"Being a professional is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don't feel like doing them." -Juilus Irving
"The moment when you feel that, just possibly, you're walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That's the moment you may be starting to get it right." -Neil Gaiman
