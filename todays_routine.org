"Investing in yourself is the most important investment you'll ever make in your life...there's no financial investment that'll ever match it, because if you develop more skill, more ability, more insight, more capacity, that's what's really going to provide economic freedom." -Warren Buffet
"Your body is designed for success in the past. It is an antique biological machine that evolved in response to a world that no longer exists." -Zimbardo
